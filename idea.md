Is a Distributed Virtual World (D-VW)

## Overview
I want to build a real-time, multiplayer, persistent virtual world where players can interact with objects, each other, and the environment. This project combines aspects of rendering, networking, physics, databases, and user interface development.

---

## Key Features (Dreams):
1. **Massive Multiplayer**:
   - Support for at least 100 simultaneous players in the same virtual world.
   - Use my networking engine 'Silah' (under development) to manage client-server communication.

2. **Dynamic World**:
   - Fully interactive world with physics using 'Madar' (under development).
   - Allow players to manipulate objects, create structures, or trigger events.

3. **Rendering**:
   - Use my rendering engine 'Noor' (under development) for real-time 3D graphics.
   - Incorporate advanced rendering techniques (e.g., PBR, shadow mapping).

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Create a database to store player data, world state, and inventory persistence.
   - My own database engine `not yet implemented`

5. **AI-Driven NPCs**:
   - Develop AI-driven NPCs with simple behaviors (e.g., patrol, interact, or defend).
   - My own AI engine `not yet implemented`

6. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Make the game playable on Linux, Windows, and macOS. 

7. **Custom Tools**:
   - Build a world editor for designing levels and placing objects.

8. **Security**:
   - Implement measures to defend against cheating and DDoS attacks.
   - Use encryption for player credentials and data.

## What I Need to Learn
- **Distributed Systems**: Managing a consistent world state across many clients.
- **Optimization**: Efficiently rendering, simulating, and networking in a high-load environment.
- **Concurrency**: Multithreading and parallel processing for game loops and networking.
- **Low-Level Programming**: Working with OpenGL, raw TCP/UDP sockets, and optimized data structures.
- **UX/UI Design**: Designing an intuitive user interface for the game and tools.
- **DevOps**: Deploying and scaling servers to handle real-world loads.

## Milestones
### 1. **Core Systems**:
   - Basic server-client communication.
   - Basic rendering of a single scene.

### 2. **Physics and Networking**:
   - Integrate 'Madar' for object physics.
   - Synchronize physics updates across clients using 'Silah'.

### 3. **Basic Gameplay**:
   - Implement player movement and interactions with objects.

### 4. **Persistent World**:
   - Add database support to save and load game states.

### 5. **Advanced Rendering**:
   - Implement advanced graphics features (e.g., reflections, shaders).

### 6. **AI & NPCs**:
   - Create simple NPCs with pathfinding and basic behaviors.

### 7. **Final Polish**:
   - Add UI, bug fixes, and testing.
